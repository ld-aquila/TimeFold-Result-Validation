== Goal of the Experiment

The purpose of this experiment is to validate whether the TimeFold application behaves consistently across different hardware architectures (Intel, AMD, Mac) when run with identical CPU specifications (e.g., same number of cores, threads, and resources). This validation is essential because other applications have exhibited inconsistent behavior across different architectures despite having the same configurations. We are using TimeFold as a test case to determine whether it produces reliable and consistent results across architectures.

== Requirements & Prerequisites

=== Hardware
- Machines with different architectures:
- Intel-based machine
- AMD-based machine
- Mac machine (ARM-based)
- At least 2G of RAM
- At lest 4 CPU cores

=== Software
- `docker` & `docker-compose` installed on all machines to create consistent environments across architectures.
- docker version 27.3.1 or above
- docker-compose version 1.29.2 or above

== How to Run the Application
- the only command to run is `docker-compose up`

== Where Are the Results Stored?
- files are stored in `data/results/<jobId>` folder
- inside the above folder two files are being created prefixed with:

-> `system_`: details about CPU, RAM, Java heap size, and utilization for the run on a particular architecture

-> `score_`: the score explanation and the vehicle routing results in text form.

=== Cross-Architecture Validation
- the application is modified to gather performance data and validate the consistency of results across different architectures.
- docker settings are limited to 4 CPU cores and 2G

== Discussion

- this experiment evaluates the performance and consistency of the TimeFold application across different architectures (Intel, AMD, Mac) under the same configuration. The goal is to validate that TimeFold produces consistent results across different architectures, unlike other applications that have shown discrepancies.
- by examining CPU, RAM, and Java heap utilization and comparing the routing results, we can determine if architecture has any significant impact on the outcome. This validation is crucial for understanding the cross-architecture behavior of TimeFold and confirming its reliability in diverse hardware environments.
